# ColorfulCalc

## 📖 Overview
ColorfulCalc is a lightweight, **color‑coded** web calculator built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  It runs entirely in the browser, so there are no build steps or server‑side dependencies.  The goal is to provide a fast, accessible calculator that works on any modern desktop or mobile browser.

## ✨ Features
- **Basic arithmetic**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- **Parentheses support** for complex expressions.
- **Clear (C)** and **Backspace** for editing.
- **Keyboard integration** – all keys work as expected.
- **Responsive design** that adapts to small screens.
- **Accessible**: ARIA attributes, role declarations, and semantic markup.
- **Colorful UI**: each button type has a distinct color for quick visual identification.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – structure and semantic markup.
- **CSS3** – styling, layout, and responsive design.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – event handling and calculator logic.

No frameworks or build tools are required.
